#Managing the MongoDB Service

To verify the status of the service, type
sudo systemctl status mongodb
You can stop the server anytime by typing:
sudo systemctl stop mongodb
To start the server when it is stopped, type:
sudo systemctl start mongodb
You can also restart the server with a single command:

sudo systemctl restart mongodb

By default, MongoDB is configured to start automatically with the server. If you wish to disable the automatic startup, type:
sudo systemctl disable mongodb
Itâ€™s just as easy to enable it again. To do this, use:
sudo systemctl enable mongodb


We can verify this further by actually connecting to the database server and executing a diagnostic command

Execute this command:
mongo --eval 'db.runCommand({ connectionStatus: 1 })'
