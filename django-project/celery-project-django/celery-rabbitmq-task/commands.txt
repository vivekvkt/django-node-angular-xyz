The syntax of these crontab expressions are very flexible. Some examples:

Example	Meaning
crontab()	Execute every minute.
crontab(minute=0, hour=0)	Execute daily at midnight.
crontab(minute=0, hour="*/3")	Execute every three hours: 3am, 6am, 9am, noon, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm.
crontab(minute=0,
hour=[0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21])
Same as previous.
crontab(minute="*/15")	Execute every 15 minutes.
crontab(day_of_week="sunday")	Execute every minute (!) at Sundays.
crontab(minute="*",
hour="*", day_of_week="sun")
Same as previous.
crontab(minute="*/10",
hour="3,17,22", day_of_week="thu,fri")
Execute every ten minutes, but only between 3-4 am, 5-6 pm and 10-11 pm on Thursdays or Fridays.
crontab(minute=0, hour="*/2,*/3")	Execute every even hour, and every hour divisible by three. This means: at every hour except: 1am, 5am, 7am, 11am, 1pm, 5pm, 7pm, 11pm
crontab(minute=0, hour="*/5")	Execute hour divisible by 5. This means that it is triggered at 3pm, not 5pm (since 3pm equals the 24-hour clock value of “15”, which is divisible by 5).
crontab(minute=0, hour="*/3,8-17")	Execute every hour divisible by 3, and every hour during office hours (8am-5pm).
